My first discord bot using nodejs and Typescript in windows environment.

To make it work ,need to download the lavalink and then the node modules

lavalink : https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1

Extract and put it in home folder or root of the bot's folder

To download node modules,after copying/downloading all the components of the bot, just type in powershell: npm i 

And also remember that you have to have nodejs installed in your system and chnge the bot token to yours one.
